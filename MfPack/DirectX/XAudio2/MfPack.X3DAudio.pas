// 28/05/2020                     Kraftwerk release. (WIN10 May 2020 update, version 20H1)
//------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Remarks:
//
//             1.  Definition of terms:
//                     LFE: Low Frequency Effect -- always omnidirectional.
//                     LPF: Low Pass Filter, divided into two classifications:
//                          Direct -- Applied to the direct signal path,
//                                    used for obstruction/occlusion effects.
//                          Reverb -- Applied to the reverb signal path,
//                                    used for occlusion effects only.
// 
//             2.  Volume level is expressed as a linear amplitude scaler:
//                 1.0 represents no attenuation applied to the original signal,
//                 0.5 denotes an attenuation of 6dB, and 0.0 results in silence.
//                 Amplification (volume > 1.0) is also allowed, and is not clamped.
// 
//                 LPF values range from 1.0 representing all frequencies pass through,
//                 to 0.0 which results in silence as all frequencies are filtered out.
// 
//             3.  X3DAudio uses a left-handed Cartesian coordinate system with values
//                 on the x-axis increasing from left to right, on the y-axis from
//                 bottom to top, and on the z-axis from near to far.
//                 Azimuths are measured clockwise from a given reference direction.
// 
//                 Distance measurement is with respect to user-defined world units.
//                 Applications may provide coordinates using any system of measure
//                 as all non-normalized calculations are scale invariant, with such
//                 operations natively occurring in user-defined world unit space.
//                 Metric constants are supplied only as a convenience.
//                 Distance is calculated using the Euclidean norm formula.
// 
//             4.  Only real values are permissible with functions using 32-bit
//                 float parameters -- NAN and infinite values are not accepted.
//                 All computation occurs in 32-bit precision mode.

  //                 May be omnidirectional or directional using a cone.
  //                 The cone originates from the emitter base position,
  //                 and is directed by the emitter's front orientation.
  //
  // Multi-point  -- For use with multi-channel sounds.
  //                 Each non-LFE channel is positioned using an
  //                 azimuth along the channel radius with respect to the
  //                 front orientation vector in the plane orthogonal to the
  //                 top orientation vector.  An azimuth of X3DAUDIO_2PI
  //                 specifies a channel is an LFE.  Such channels are
  //                 positioned at the emitter base and are calculated
  //                 with respect to pLFECurve only, never pVolumeCurve.
  //
  //                 Multi-point emitters are always omnidirectional,
  //                 i.e. the cone is ignored if the number of channels > 1.
  //
  // Note that many properties are shared among all channel points,
  // locking certain behaviour with respect to the emitter base position.
  // For example, doppler shift is always calculated with respect to the
  // emitter base position and so is constant for all its channel points.
  // Distance curve calculations are also with respect to the emitter base
  // position, with the curves being calculated independently of each other.
